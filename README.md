### Thomas High School Math scores
Math scores were placed in NaN (not a number) so there was not impact on the claculating the scores. There was no placement of the "0" because it would have negative impact on the results. As noted in the table below, the ninth grade results were placed in a NaN. The following are the results by grade:
 - 9th Grade - NaN
 - 10th Grade - 83.1
 - 11th Grade - 83.5
 - 12th Grade - 83.5

### Thomas High Scool Reading scores
Just like the math scores, the reading scores were analized the same way.  As a result, the 9th grade reading scores were also placed in a NaN value.  As noted in the table below, the following are the results by grade:
 - 9th Grade - NaN
 - 10th Grade - 84.3
 - 11th Grade - 83.6
 - 12th Grade - 84.3
